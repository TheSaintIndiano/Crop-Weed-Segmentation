# Crop/Plant & Weed segmentation

# Introduction

In this notebook, we will segment crop/weed, single plant phenotyping and other open computer vision tasks in precision agriculture. The dataset comprises 60 images with annotations and is available online (http://github.com/cwfid). All images were acquired with the autonomous field robot Bonirob in an organic carrot farm while the carrot plants were in early true leaf growth stage. Intra- and inter-row weeds were present, weed and crop were approximately of the same size and grew close together. For every dataset image there is a ground truth vegetation segmentation mask and manual annotation of the plant type (crop vs. weed).
